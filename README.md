# monopoly
A game Monopoly which I created myself using the knowledges I got during learning node.js(a little bit), js, html and css. I am going to be a cool programmer
clientScripts.js -code on the client side
monopoly.js - server side code
IF you want to play this game open monopoly.js, find the line where it starts the local server and change it localhost, or whatever you want. Then you are able to play.
